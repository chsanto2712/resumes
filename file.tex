% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
    Hello there
    Is this working fine?

\end{document} % This is the end of the document
